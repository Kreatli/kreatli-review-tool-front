            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
            Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently,

            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Kreatli) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by
            parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable
            third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,
            interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your

            Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our

            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by

            Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar

            are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has
            visited our Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor&nbsp;the
            traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies,
            to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party
            website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many

            impair their functioning.
